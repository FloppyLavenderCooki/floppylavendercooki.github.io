# ðŸ’¡ Our Goal
Our project wouldn't be complete without a goal... right?

## ðŸŽ® Game
This is the core of our project. We plan on leveraging tools such as Godot to design and build a game project, to show our ideas of what a smart library could look and function like. <br>
The game will feature a smart library at the core, which a player can explore to learn more about what makes a library "smart", and what can make a library. The user can also create an account which can simulate the true library member experience.

## ðŸ“± Membership System, App & Card
This aspect of our project acts as a proof-of-concept of what a membership system could look like in real life. <br>
This part of our project includes 3 main components: <br>
1. Membership App: An iOS and web based application for managing memberships <br>
2. Database: A Firebase datastore for containing user information and data. <br>
3. Card: A real life card with NFC capabilities, containing a design for our library, and links to the user's account. This card can be used in conjunction with the iOS app to quickly tap into your information at a glance (quite literally tap into). <br>

As this aims to be a proof-of-concept, many functions and features may not ship if this were used as a base in a real-world scenario, such as the "security" on the database, however aims to exhibit our idea of an ideal app.
