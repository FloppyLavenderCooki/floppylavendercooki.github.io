# üóìÔ∏è May 2
The term break has ended, and we've made significant progress on our project!

## Game
Jarvis added sprinting to the player controller and view bobbing to the camera.

Arav exported his kiosk model from Maya into FBX and Kieran exported his bookshelf model from
Blender into FBX in order to be able to use each model without their respective platform installed.

Arav also created a script that lets the player pick up books (just cubes for now) and rotate them around.
He also added a "nonfunctional spherecast" that is supposed to get detect when the player is touching the
ground to allow jumping again. Arav also added a cursor so you can tell exactly where you're looking at.

## App
Our app is almost complete by this stage. Users can now view their levelling information
based on their card, view their issued books, returns, and we've seemed to come closer to our final UI choices.
