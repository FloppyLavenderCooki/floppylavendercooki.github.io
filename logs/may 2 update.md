# üóìÔ∏è May 2
The term break has ended and we've made significant progress on our project!

## Game
We decided that Godot would not suit our needs for developing our game, and we switched to a more mainstream game engine called **Unity**. Utilising this platform we should be able to better develop our game, and finally get to working on our game project.

## App
Our app is almost complete by this stage. Users can now view their levelling information based on their card, view their issued books, returns, and we've seem to come closer to our final UI choices.
