## Game
We are still in the process of setting up the game environment and making sure we have all the plugins and assets we need.
Arav has modelled the library kiosk in Maya, which will be used in the game for depositing the books.
We also added FMOD and Steam Audio to the project, which will be used for adaptive/reactive audio when we add that in.
