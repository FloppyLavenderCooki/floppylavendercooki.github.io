We are Group 2 (yes, that is because we are the second group in the project).<br>
We like coding and designing stuff. On our blog you will find logs and updates on the various aspects of our project.

Hey, I'm Arav and I enjoy most things to do with programming and technology. I am overseeing this project as team leader, however all of us have been friends for a long time and work very well together. I primarily work on game and app projects, with my favourite tools and languages including Unity, Sketch, Maya, C#, Swift, and HTML/CSS. I have been reading pretty much as long as I have been alive, and I think it's important that everyone can access and read books no matter who they are.

Hiya, I'm Jarvis. I'm 15 (as of 24/2/25) years old, and I really enjoy programming. My favourite languages to use are Rust, Zig, and Nim, but I also dabble in a bit of C++. Reading has been one of my passions since a very young age, and I think that everyone should have equal access to reading material.

## More About Us
We are primarily making a game about smart libraries. Throughout, we aim to create more innovative solutions to problems that exist within normal libraries, and build features which can make libraries more convenient and accessible for anyone.
