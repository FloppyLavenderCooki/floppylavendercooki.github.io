Hiya, I'm Jarvis. I'm 15 (as of 24/2/25) years old, and I really enjoy programming. My favourite languages to use are Rust, Zig, and Nim, but I also dabble in a bit of C++. Reading has been one of my passions since a very young age, and I think that everyone should have equal access to reading material.

## Conclusion
We are making a game about smart libraries. On the way, we're also developing a new solution for library cards and overdue fee payment.
