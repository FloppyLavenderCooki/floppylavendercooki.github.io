By this point, our group has successfully made communications with our groupmates from Shanghai. The students we are going to be working with are very great people, and are passionate about this topic like we are.

Significant progress has been made towards our group's game and app project as well:

## Game
We started working on our game. After discussions as a group, we landed on **Godot** as our game engine of choice, as it is relatively easy to use and preferred by most of the group.
To sort out our progress and keep track of everything we need to complete, we decided to employ the use of **Notion**, which is a user-friendly web software to keep track of tasks as a group.

As we continue to progress on our game, we add tasks to the tracker to make sure we know what to do and when.

## App
The iOS membership app has undertaken the most progress in terms of completion, and functionality. So far, only Arav has been working on the app, however Jarvis has downloaded Xcode and aims to help in developing the app.

We plan on writing an article dedicated to our app, however it has been designed with users in mind, from the youngest children, to the oldest bookworms. The design depicted in the above image is not finalised, and the design is yet to take its final form. This is the basis upon which we will fully build and deploy our application.

One of the biggest hurdles have shown itself early in the development cycle, and this is the availability of NFC reading capabilities. As laid out in our project plan, we designed the app to allow users to simply tap their membership card onto their mobile device, and quickly access their user information. This comes with a major development caveat of the requirement of a paid Apple Development License. Being students, this is out of our scope in terms of availability and price, and we are currently looking for alternatives.

## Member Card

As a group we designed a member card, which is stylish, easy to use, and contains enough information for the user. It follows a standard card-size, easy to fit in any wallet, and contains a NFC chip. Due to how proprietary the NFC chip was, we decided to link the card's serial number to the user that owns the card. The member card can be used at a library kiosk (assuming we made real ones) and on a mobile device to access membership information.
