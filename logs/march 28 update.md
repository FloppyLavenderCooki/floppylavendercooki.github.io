Today, Jarvis started work on creating a Survey to be sent out to a group of students (we still haven't decided who to send it to.) The Survey is about the Wellington Central Library, libraries around Wellington, and how often people use libraries. We hope that this can give us valuable insight into the students of Scots College and their reading / library usage habits.
