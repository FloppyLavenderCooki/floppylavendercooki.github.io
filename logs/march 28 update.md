# üóìÔ∏è March 28

We created a Microsoft Form to gather data about Wellington City Libraries and what people think of them.
Some examples of questions are:

- Do you use a library on a regular basis?

- Were you living in Wellington prior to the closure of the Wellington Central Library (before March 2019)

- What is your opinion on the current state of Libraries in Wellington?

If people taking the form choose 'yes' for living in Wellington,
they will be asked a question about whether they used it. This keeps the questions relevant to the user.
So far, we haven't sent out the form yet as we need to figure out who to send it to.
