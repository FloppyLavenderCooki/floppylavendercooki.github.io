# ğŸ“± Our App
## COMPLETION LOG!
The app is now finally completed! To re-iterate:
The app should let users
- View library's expansive catalog
- View user statuses (such as level, card details, personal info)
- View books user has issued, and reserve more library books.

### ğŸ“• About
The app is developed using Apple's Swift programming language and the SwiftUI framework. It incorporates Google's Firebase services where we store our library data, such as the catalog and user information.
To learn more about the specific modules we used, you can look at [our source code](https://github.com/FloppyLavenderCooki/memberApp-iOS)

### ğŸ“— Functionality
The users can login with their created account to view their information.
You can also view the catalog, including descriptions of each book. Each book in the catalog can also be reserved to collect in the library.
You can see what books you've issued, and then you can see their due dates.

Things we didn't get working:
NFC. One of the big parts of our app was that you can scan your membership card to your phone to quick log in. However, while the fundamental code is present in the files to have this work, we would have to pay upward of ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ $200 ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ğŸ’¸ for the App Store license.
