## Game
We haven't made much progress on our game. We added a movement controller, and a couple of objects. More importantly, however, we have setup some of our planning for our game. The purpose of our game is to show the difference between a smart library and a normal library. This is to educate on why smart libraries are better, and why we should fund and construct and develop these instead.

## App
Our app now allows users to seamlessly browse the entire catalogue, which is dynamically loaded from our Firebase database. This update ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date selection of items available.
