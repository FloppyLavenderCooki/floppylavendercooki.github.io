### Presentation Day
By this point the project was over, and it was time to present our work alongside our counterpart in Shanghai. We showed off the various features of our project, from our planning, app, game, and what we learnt during the process.

We think the overall  project was hugely successful, we learnt lots about smart library infrastructure and how we can use technology to improve access to reading for all.
